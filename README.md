# Asio.cmake

[![ðŸ‘· compilation](https://github.com/OlivierLDff/asio.cmake/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OlivierLDff/asio.cmake/actions/workflows/main.yml)

CMake wrapper to add [asio](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio) with a simple FetchContent as a static library.

## ðŸš€ How to use

### [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html)

Use `FetchContent` to add this repository in your cmake script.

```cmake
# Force the script to use FetchContent and not CPM internally to fetch asio
option(ASIO_USE_CPM "Download Asio with CPM instead of FetchContent" OFF)
option(
  ASIO_CPM_FETCHCONTENT_COMPAT
  "Should asio be declared with FetchContent functions to be compatible. This doesn't not allow CPM cache to work."
  ON
)
# Download this repository
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  asiocmake
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/OlivierLDff/asio.cmake"
  GIT_TAG        "main"
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(asiocmake)

# ...

# Link to the created library asio::asio or asio
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE asio::asio)
```

### [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake)

Or with CPM even an easier integration.

```cmake
include(cmake/CPM.cmake)

CPMAddPackage(
  NAME asiocmake
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/OlivierLDff/asio.cmake"
  GIT_TAG "main"
)

# ...

# Link to the created library asio::asio or asio
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE asio::asio)
```

### Customization

* `ASIO_TAG`: Tag of asio that will be used. *Default: `master`*
* `ASIO_USE_CPM`: Download Asio with CPM instead of FetchContent. *Default: `OFF`*
